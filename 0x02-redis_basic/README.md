## Introduction
This project introduces the basics of Redis, an in-memory data structure store used as a database, cache, and message broker. The focus is on understanding Redis operations, implementing basic Redis commands in Python, and exploring Redis’ utility in various applications.

## Requirements
- **Python 3.6+**
- **Redis Server 5.0+**
- **Redis-py**: Python Redis client library
- **pip**: Python package installer

## Installation

1. **Install Redis**:
    - On Linux:
      ```bash
      sudo apt update
      sudo apt install redis-server
      ```
    - On MacOS:
      ```bash
      brew install redis
      ```

2. **Start Redis Server**:
    ```bash
    redis-server
    ```

3. **Install Python Dependencies**:
    - Create a virtual environment:
      ```bash
      python3 -m venv venv
      source venv/bin/activate
      ```
    - Install required packages:
      ```bash
      pip install redis
      ```

## Usage

1. **Connecting to Redis**:
    - In your Python script, you can connect to the Redis server as follows:
      ```python
      import redis

      r = redis.Redis(host='localhost', port=6379, db=0)
      ```

2. **Basic Redis Commands**:
    - Set a value in Redis:
      ```python
      r.set('key', 'value')
      ```
    - Get a value from Redis:
      ```python
      value = r.get('key')
      print(value.decode('utf-8'))
      ```

3. **Running the Project**:
    - Execute your Python scripts with Redis commands:
      ```bash
      python your_script.py
      ```

## Tasks

### Task 0: Writing Strings
- **Objective:** Implement a function that writes and reads strings to and from Redis.

### Task 1: Expiring Keys
- **Objective:** Implement a method to set a key with an expiration time.

### Task 2: Counting Visits
- **Objective:** Create a function that counts the number of visits to a webpage using Redis.

### Task 3: Storing Web Sessions
- **Objective:** Implement session management using Redis to store user sessions.

### Task 4: Caching
- **Objective:** Develop a simple caching mechanism using Redis to store frequently accessed data.
